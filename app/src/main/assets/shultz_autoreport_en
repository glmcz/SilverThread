<br>     <b>IM:</b> We talked about the stages of a person who feels an
 inner need, but can not cope with his consciousness and the like. What is needed? From time immemorial, there
 was a well-developed formula: in modern terms, it is autogenic training, meditation, and spiritual practice.
 Before, the autogenic training was called differently. There was a lot of fiction made up by people in it. But
 thanks to Schultz, who eliminated all the made-up philosophy, all the metaphysics that was previously given to
 common autogenic training… He eliminated it and derived an ordinary formula for self-suggestion, and that's it.
 That is, the work on your body by means of your consciousness. But this was just the first basic step.

<br>     <b>IM:</b> Yes, of course. This is also an interesting point, if we analyze
 the tools that people use to cognize the Spiritual World. Let's start with the simple ones. Autogenic training…
 What is autogenic training and based on what does it function? After all, autogenic training in itself is
 exactly an awareness of oneself, the shifting of your "I" from the secondary consciousness to the primary
 consciousness and work with the primary consciousness at the level of the primary consciousness. That is why it
 is an important tool, and it has existed in all spiritual practices. Now we call it autogenic training in some
 transformed, altered form, thanks to Schultz, as we have already said. But it works at the level of the primary
 consciousness, that is why various changes in the body and the like happen.

<br>Follow these steps to practice autogenic training:
<br>    Autogenous training exercise are held in three main poses: lying, reclining and in the coachman position. Lying posture: a man lies on his back, arms are extended parallel to the body and slightly bent at the elbows, palms are facing down, knees and toes of the feet are apart, eyes are closed, muscles are relaxed. Reclining posture: a person reclining in a chair with armrests, body muscles are relaxed, as it happens when falling asleep. The coachman’s pose: a man sits without touching the back of a chair, legs are bent at the knees, slightly apart, eyes are closed, his head fell freely on his chest. Being in this position, a person is like a coachman dozing on a goat.
<br>    Along with the pronunciation of commands a person experiences complete peace of mind.
<br>    Take a few slow even breaths. If you have not already, spend a few minutes practicing diaphragmatic breathing.
<br>    At the first stage, the following verbal formulas of self-commands are pronounced:
<br>
<br>    Quietly say to yourself, "I am completely calm."
<br>
<br>    Focus attention on your right arm. Quietly and slowly repeat to yourself, "My
 right arm is very heavy."
<br>    Focus attention on your left arm. Quietly and slowly repeat to yourself, "My
 left arm is very heavy."

<br>    Focus attention on your left leg. Quietly and slowly repeat to yourself, "My
 left leg is very heavy."
<br>    Focus attention on your legs. Quietly and slowly repeat to yourself six, "My
 legs are very heavy."
<br>
<br>    Refocus attention on your right arm again. Quietly and slowly repeat to
 yourself, "My right arm is very warm."
<br>    Focus attention on your left arm. Quietly and slowly repeat to yourself, "My
