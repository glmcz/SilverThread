<br>     <i>Today, we will do the same meditation as last
    time, to purify thoughts. For those who were absent, I will repeat. So, stand comfortably, legs at shoulders’
    width. Hands should touch each other with the tips of the fingers at the level of the belly, tip to tip. In
    other words, thumb to thumb, forefinger to forefinger, and so forth. Like this.” </i>
<br>    Sensei showed me this connection.
<br>     <i> “It is necessary to relax by removing all thoughts and to
    concentrate only on normal breathing. Then, when you have reached a state of full relaxation of all extremities
    and a feeling of inner peace, begin to imagine that you are a jug. In other words, the top part of your head is
    as if cut off like in a jug… The source of water is the soul. This water fills your whole body and, in the end,
    overfills it, spilling over the edge of the jug, streaming down the body and into the earth. During this
    process, as it fills the body and flows out into the earth, it takes with it all of the bad thoughts, all the
    problems; in other words, all that dirt and unrest present in your mind. It is as if you are cleansing
    yourselves inside. And when you purify yourselves this way, you begin to feel a clear division of soul and
    thought: the soul located inside of you and the soul located above the jug which is observing the process. </i>
    And finally, by practicing this meditation every day, you cleanse your thoughts of all the negative ones and
    further learn to control them, all the while keeping your mind in a ‘clean’ state… Any questions?”
<br>     “Why should the hands touch exactly this way?” I asked.
<br>     “Because during this meditation, certain energies circulate inside of the
    body. I will tell you more about them later. The tips of the fingers need to close the circuit. Furthermore,
    there is a stimulation of the skin nerve receptors located on the tips of fingers, which affects the brain in a
    positive and calming way… Are there any other questions?”
<br>    Everybody remained silent.
<br>     “Then let’s begin.”
<br>    Under Sensei’s guidance, we began to perform this meditation. I tried to
    imagine myself as a jug, but my imagination formed this image somehow only half-way, because my mind just
    couldn’t agree with this definition. I stopped trying to prove anything to myself and simply thought, “I am a
    jug,” and concentrated on the ‘internal source of water’. An interesting feeling appeared, as if my
    consciousness went inside of me, went into my soul, and concentrated in the form of a point in the area of the
    solar plexus. That point began to widen gradually while crystal clear water spiralled in it. Finally, there was
    so much water that it poured over, filling my entire body with its pleasant moisture. Filling the ‘vessel’ this
    way, this pleasant feeling ‘flowed over the edge’. A wave of gentle goosebumps started to run over my body from
    top to bottom, as though going into the earth. I imagined that my body was being cleansed of all bad thoughts.
    And in one moment, I felt so nice inside, so cozy, and so joyful that I couldn’t resist and slightly deviated
    from the meditation, thanking God for all that He gave me in life, for all His Love for His children. In the
    next moment, I suddenly discovered that my consciousness, in other words, my real “I”, was seemingly above my
    body. But my body didn’t look like a body at all. From its ‘jug-like’ head emanated thousands of thin,
    multi-coloured threads which went into the ground in a continuous movement. In the depth of the jug, something
    bright was shining, transforming these threads into more vivid colours. The beauty was simply spellbinding. But
    then I heard Sensei’s melodious voice, reaching me from somewhere far away.
<br>     <i> “And now take two deep, quick breaths in and out. Quickly clench
    and unclench your fists. Open your eyes.” </i>
<br>    I quickly came to my senses, though the state of this internal euphoria stayed
    somewhere in the depth of my “I”. As it later turned out, each of the guys experienced this state differently.
    The senior guys did it better than I did, while for my friends it all transpired only at the level of bare
    imagination. Sensei told them that for many people, it often happens this way at first. However, if they
    practice persistently at home every day and have a desire to improve their moral qualities, then in time they
    would experience new feelings and learn to constantly control their thoughts. The most important thing is to
    believe in themselves, in their powers, and not to be lazy.

<br>    The days flew by in a blink of an eye. I liked this new meditation so much
    that I performed it with pleasure before going to bed though, just like all the previous ones, in turn. One day,
    I asked Sensei whether it’s harmful to do them one after another in one evening. He replied that, quite on the
    contrary, it was very useful because then a human works more on himself spiritually, while the ‘Lotus Flower’
    awakens the soul as well. “It’s better to perform them in the evening before going to bed and in the morning
    when you wake up. These are the simplest meditations to work on the concentration of attention, the awakening of
    internal sight, and control over thoughts. They are absolutely harmless; that’s why everybody can learn them,
    even those who have never come across any spiritual practices. And at the same time, these meditations, being
    simple and clear, bring the most results.”

<br>    We performed the same meditation as last time, aimed at ‘cleansing our
    intentions’. I already started to feel the ‘water’ more clearly, streaming over the edge of the jug with some
    kind of wavy movement. After the training, the Teacher reminded us to continuously learn to control our thoughts
    and ‘fish out’ negative ‘parasites’ of consciousness. He also emphasized that we shouldn’t give in to our
    aggression, if it appears. And the most important thing, we should constantly cultivate divine Love in ourselves
    by performing the ‘Lotus Flower’.
